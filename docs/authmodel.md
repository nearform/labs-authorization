# Examples of organization structures modeled with Udaru

Access to resources can be modeled in Udaru through the elements that it provides: Organizations, Teams, Users. Policies can be attached to any of these elements. For more details, see the [Udaru Introduction][].

The usual modeling case is to build independent organizations, each organization having teams (or nested teams) attached to them and users attached to teams. Policies are attached to Organizations, Teams or Users.

In the examples below in the **Cross organization access management** section it is described a particular case in which we need users that have access rights over several organizations. This corner case is not the perfect match for the Udaru architecture but it can be achieved using the shallow impersonation feature.

## Modeling a simple blog

This section implements a practical example on how to model a very simple blog.

### Context

The problem to be solved is:

The blog named BlogX is a very simple one. It can be managed by an administrator, `Alice`, who can do pretty much anything on the blog, a writer,`Bob` who can both write and publish articles, and readers can read the articles.

There are 2 kinds of articles, published ones, and drafts. Readers, which are anonymous, can only see published articles. Administrators and Writers can see both of published articles and drafts.

### Model structure

The structure to be modeled is the following:

An organization `BlogX org` to which all content creators and blog admins are attached : a team for each kind of role in the workflow (`Writers`, `Publishers`), for having an easy time understanding why some rights are bound and ease separation of concern when the BlogX team will grow.

Another organization, `BlogXReaders org` to which all content consumers are attached : for now, a single anonymous makes sense, as we don't have fancy feature like registered users and comment system, so we just will keep it simple.

We have detached the concept of content consumers from the content creator org to ensure good separation between the content creators and the content consumers, and avoid any security issue due to some bad human manipulation.

A visual representation of the structure:

```
  --------------------------     -------------------------
  |       BlogX org        |     |    BlogXReaders org   |
  --------------------------     -------------------------
   |       |       |                        |
 Admins  Writers Publishers              Anonymous
   |         \    /
 Alice        Bob

```

### Solution

**Note:** We will create a policy to be able to read any published article, attributed to everyone. Keeping a policy for this instead of not checking for anything should allow easy evolutions in the long run, like adding a paywall, and allow some articles to be read entirely only by paying consumers.

We will assign policies that gives members and their teams/org meaningful rights on documents in the workflow, according to the "work" they should do.

For `BlogX org` we will create those constraints:
-   Any member of the `BlogX org` should be able to `search` and `read` any `draft`, `published` or `unpublished` articles.
-   `Admins` team can do anything on the `BlogX org` platform, while not likely to create any content, they need to be able to run real life tests.
-   `Writers` team can `create`, `read` any `draft` articles, and they should be able to `update`, `comment` and `delete` their own `draft` articles.
-   `Publishers` team can `comment`, `update`, `delete` or `publish` any `draft` article, and should be able to `unpublish` any `published` article

For `BlogXReaders org` we will create those constraints:
-   `Anonymous` user can `read` and `search` for any `published` article.
-   In order to be safe and prevent any human error, we will also ensure that `Anonymous` user **cannot** `create`, `update`, `delete`, `publish` any articles, and **cannot** `read` or `search` any `draft` or `unpublished` articles.


A fully working model sample can be seen in the [Full organization test file][] in the "Simple Blog" Experiment.

## Cross organization access management

This example describes how to model an organization in which it is needed to have users that have access rights over several organizations and have limited access rights on other organizations.

### Context

In Udaru all operations are performed in the organization context: for each user request Udaru finds the organization to which the user belongs to and from there all middleware checks and element queries are made in the organization context. One user can't perform operations outside the organization to which it belongs to. The user identifier is passed in the Http headers as the `authorization` field.

There is a special type of Udaru users, named SuperUsers, that belong to the 'ROOT' organization. SuperUsers can be assigned full access rights on all actions on all resources. To be able to do operations as SuperUser on an Organization, Udaru provides an impersonation functionality: by passing in the Http headers an 'org' field, the endpoint request is made as if the SuperUser belongs to the 'org' organization thus having acess to all the exposed Udaru functionality for that organization (like user management, team management).

curl impersonation example in which a SuperUser impersonates an user belonging to the `WONKA` organization:
```javascript
curl -X PUT --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' --header 'authorization: ROOTID' --header 'org: WONKA' -d '{"policies":["PolicyID"]}' 'http://localhost:8080/authorization/teams/TeamID/policies'
```

### Needed model structure

The structure to be modeled is the following:

We have the default root organization on which we have two Teams. On the first team there are two users, on the 2nd team there is one user and the 4th user belongs to no team. All the 4 users belong to the root organization.
We plan to add to Team1 a set of policies so that the User1 and User2 have access to resources from Org1 and Org2, then assign to Team2 a set of policies so that User3 has access to Org3. User4 has no policies attached and has no access to any of the Organizations.

A visual representation of the structure:
```
  -------------------   --------   --------   --------
  |     rootOrg     |   | Org1 |   | Org2 |   | Org3 |
  -------------------   --------   --------   --------
     /        \   \
   Team1     Team2 \
   /   \       |    \
 User1 User2 User3  User4
```

### Solution

One **limitation** of this modelling approach is that we have to build the route access policies and also the resource access policies in the root organization so that they can be attached to the SuperUser teams. The policy management is made at the root organization level.

The structure is build like it is described in the previous section.
The organization endpoints access policies and organization resource access policies are attached to the two teams.

A fully working model sample can be seen in the [Full organization test file][] in the "SuperUsers with limited access across organizations" Experiment.

The policies built to configure access structure are of three types:
-   Access to organization management operations is given by attaching to the two root teams the default organization policies: `authorization:organizations:read` rights to be able to access the `/authorization/organizations/<orgId>` endpoint, `authorization:teams:*` rights to allow access to `/authorization/teams/*` endpoints, `authorization:users:*` rights to allow access to `/authorization/users/*` endpoints, `authorization:policies:list` rights to access the `/authorization/policies` endpoint, `authorization:policies:read` rights to access the `/authorization/policies/<policyId>` endpoint,
-   Access to the authorization check endpoint is given by attaching to teams a policy that gives `authorization:authn:access` rights to allow access on `/authorization/access/{userId}/{action}/{resource*}` endpoint,
-   Access to internal organization policies is given by defining specific internal organization actions and resources.
